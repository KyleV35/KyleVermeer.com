        <p class="center_text section_heading">About Kyle</p>
        <p class="justify_text"> My name is Kyle Manuel Gonzalez Vermeer and I am a senior at Stanford University.
        I am currently studying Computer Science and I plan to graduate with a B.S. in the spring. After graduation,
        I would love to do work on cool new mobile or web applications.  I plan to stay around the Bay Area, but 
        wouldn't be opposed to seeing more of the world.  After working in industry, I would love nothing more than
        to teach and coach basketball at my high school, <a href="www.bcp.org">Bellarmine College Preparatory</a>.</p>
        
        <p class="center_text section_heading">Hobbies</p>
        <p class="justify_text">One of my favorite activities has always been basketball. At Stanford, I am a captain
        on the Men's Club Basketball Team.  I can often be found playing pick-up basketball on the courts at Stanford.
        When I'm not playing basketball, I try to explore web and mobile programming.  Under the <a href="/">examples</a> link
        in the navigation bar, you can see some of the work I have done in and out of class!  I also enjoy watching bad
        TV shows like Big Brother.</p>
