        <h2 class="page-header-subtitle">Chapter 1: Fundamental Techniques in Handling People</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="l-row">
        <p class="section-body">This chapter focuses on the ineffectiveness of criticism.  Criticism is ineffective in both amending behavior as well as in developing relationships with others.  I want to go over some of the concrete examples that Carnegie mentions in this chapter.</p>

        <p class="section-body">The first critique of criticism that Carnegie mentions is that people do everything in their power to never blame themselves.  Lewis Lawes, a warden of the New York Sign Sing prison declared that “few criminals in Sing Sing regard themselves as bad men.  They are just as human as you and I.  So they rationalize, they explain.  They can tell you why they had to crack a safe or be quick on the trigger finger.  Most of them attempt by a form of reasoning, fallacious or logical, to justify their antisocial acts even to themselves, consequently stoutly maintaining that they should never have been imprisoned at all”. </p>
        
        <p class="section-body">Here are two examples that Carnegie explains in depth:</p>
        
        <div class="indent">
        
            <p class="section-header">Francis “Two Gun” Crowley</a></p>
            
            <p class="section-body">1912-1932, New York City</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">At 19 years of age, Crowley and two other friends crashed a dance at the American Legion in the Bronx.  While being forcibly removed from the venue, Crowley pulled out his gun and shot two of the men who were escorting him out of the building.  After being charged with attempted murder, Crowley began his spree of murders.  Crowley murdered police officers, killed girls who resisted his advances, and robbed banks when he needed money. </p>
            
            <p class="section-body">Police ultimately arrested Crowley after a two-hour shootout with the NYPD.  During the shoot-out, Crowley wrote a note addressed to “To whom it may concern” that pleaded that he was a harmless person saying “Under my coat is a weary heart, but a kind one---one that would do nobody any harm”.</p>
            
            <p class="section-header">Al Capone</a></p>
            
            <p class="section-body">1899 – 1947, Chicago</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">Alphonse Gabriel Capone was an American gangster who terrorized Chicago during the Prohibition era.  While Capone was best known for his smuggling and bootlegging of liquor, he also committed murder and bribery in order to preserve his business.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">He was quoted saying “I have spent the best years of m life giving people the lighter pleasures, helping them have a good time, and all I get is abuse, the existence of a hunter man”.</p>
        
        </div>
        
        <p class="section-body">Carnegie implores us to consider that if people such as Al Capone and “Two Gun” Crowley don’t blame themselves for anything — do you imagine that thee people with whom you and I come in contact with blame themselves for misfortunes that befall themselves?</p>
        
        <p class="section-body">This reasoning is the launching point for Carnegie’s belief that scolding and ridiculing others is foolish.  He boldly states all of these when he asserts “Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself.  Criticism is dangerous because it wounds a person’s precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment.”  Famous psychologist B.F. Skinner performed experiments that backed this opinion, showing very positive results that animals learn much more quickly by being rewarded for good behavior than by being punished for bad behavior.  Behavioral changes from criticism tend to not last and incur resentment between people.</p>
        
        <p class="section-body">I would now like to enumerate several case studies that support these findings:</p>
        
        <div class="indent">
        
            <p class="section-header">George B. Johnston</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">Johnston was a safety coordinator for an engineering company.  One of his responsibilities was to make sure that the employees wore hard hats whenever they were working.  Originally Johnston went about this task by scolding his employees whom he found not wearing hats and demanded that they must comply.  Employees would respond, but often would do so sullenly and remove their hats once Johnston had left.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">Seeing how ineffective this approach was, Johnston decided to approach the situation entirely differently by asking the employees whom had their hats off if the hats were uncomfortable or did not fit properly.  He then reminded them that they hats were designed to keep them safe and suggested that they always be worn on the job.  Doing this, he saw a large increase in compliance that was devoid of resentment from the employees.</p>
            
            <p class="section-header">Abraham Lincoln</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">When Abraham Lincoln, was a young man, he often wrote letters and poems ridiculing people who he did not approve of.  This continued even into his career as a lawyer, until in 1842 his conflict with James Shields amended Lincoln’s ways.  Shield was a prideful politician whom Lincoln berated in the Springfield Journal.  Shields challenged Lincoln to a duel to the death and Lincoln was forced to learn how to fight with a cavalry broadsword from a West Point graduate.  When Shields and Lincoln finally were prepared to fight, their advisors called off the duel.  While no blood was shed, Lincoln realized the error of his ways and from the point on never wrote another insulting letter.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">Obviously Lincoln had many people disappoint him throughout his Presidency.  When his generals blundered during battle, the national savagely condemned their abilities.  In response, Lincoln simply stated, “Don’t criticize them; they are just what we would be under similar circumstances”.  At one point during the Civil War, General Meade of the Union had trapped General Lee’s army at a river.  Lincoln, knowing that a victory here would likely end the war immediately, commanded General Meade to attack.  Meade refused these order, despite Lincolns resolute belief that this was the correct course of action.  Lee’s army ended up escaping and thus prolonged the Civil War.  Lincoln was bitter and disappointed, and even drafted a letter that scolded General Meade for his actions.  Using his better judgment, Lincoln never sent the letter and it was only found among his papers after his death.  Lincoln realized that the letter would only arouse hard feeling with General Meade, impairing his further usefulness as a commander, and perhaps forcing him to resign from the army.  He know that the general has seen more blood and screams on the battlefield than the president ever had from his office in the quiet White House.</p>
            
            <p class="section-header">Benjamin Franklin</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">Described as tactless in his youth, Benjamin Franklin became so adept at handling people that he became the American Ambassador to France.  Franklin claimed his success came from a simple policy: “I will speak ill of no man … and speak all the good I know of everybody”.  Any fool can criticize, condemn, and complain—and most do.  But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.  “A great man shows his greatness by the way he treats little men.” – Thomas Carlyle.</p>
            
            <p class="section-header">Bob Hoover</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">Hoover was a famous test polite and performed at many air shows.  On a return flight from San Diego, both engines of his plane suddenly stopped.  Being an adept pilot, Hoover was ably to land the plane without anyone being injured.  After inspecting the plane, he discovered that the plan had been fueled with jet fuel rather than gasoline.  When he returned to the airport, Hoover asked to see the mechanic who had prepared the plane for flight.  When Hoover approached, the mechanic had tears streaming down his face, knowing exactly the damage and risk he has caused.  Instead of scolding and criticizing the mechanic, Hoover put his arm on the man’s shoulder and said “To show you I’m sure that you’ll never do this again, I want you to service my F-51 tomorrow”.</p>

        <p class="section-body">Carnegie finished the chapter with a piece that perfectly captures the emotion he has been explaining throughout the chapter.  The piece is called Father Forgets from W. Livingston Larned, and it can be found <a href="http://www.csua.berkeley.edu/~chrislw/dadforget.html">here</a>.</p>
        
        <p class="section-body">Carnegie calls us to understand why people do what they do, instead of criticizing them.  Understanding breeds sympathy, tolerance, and kindness, where as criticism only breeds resentment and hatred.  Thus, Carnegie leaves us with his first principle, which is...</p>
        
        <p class="book-message">Don’t criticize, condemn, or complain.</p>
